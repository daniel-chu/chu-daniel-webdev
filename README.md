# Northeastern CS4550 Web Development

## About Me

Hi, I'm Daniel Chu and I am currently finishing up my second year as an undergraduate at Northeastern University. I have gained some experience with web development through my first co-op at PowerAdvocate, as well as an online workout tracker I created as a personal project for practice. However I have never taken a formal course on this before and hope I can take away a lot from this course.


## Purpose
This repository was created as part of the web dev course requirements, so professors and TAs may look at the work I am doing.
